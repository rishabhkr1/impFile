Lombok
------
->It aims to reduce the boilerplate code that developers have to write such as
  getters,setters,constructors and more.
 
->Lombok achieves this by generating the code automatically during compilation,
  based on annotations you add to your java classes.

->Lombok generates bytecode for methods like getters,setters,constroctors,equals(),
  hascode(),and toString,as specified by the annotations used in your code.
  This generated code is addes to the compiled class files(.class files).

 eg:- @Getters, @Setters, @ToString, @RequiredArgsConstructor, @EqualsAndHashCode, @Value
      for all the avove Annotaions we can use @Data
