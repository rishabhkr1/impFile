what is Thymeleaf?
 It is a java templating engine.
 commonly used to generate the HTML views for web apps.

Where is the thymleaf template processed?
 it is processed on the server.
 So the results are included in the HTML and returned to the browser.
 So here's an example.
The web browser sends a request over to Spring MVC Controller,
the controller adds some data to the model, sends it over to the template,
and then the template sends back HTML to the web browser.

We read the data via $(Acess the attribute name from the model).
We get the data via @.

Spring has the special annotations called @RequestParam.
This will allow to read form data and automatically bind it to parameter.
