Postman
----------
Postman Makes API Development Simple.

Converting JSON to Java POJO is known as DataBinding/mapping.

@PathVariable annotation would be an endpoint that identifies an entity with a primary key

Spring calls the methods annotated with @PostConstruct only once, just after the initialization of bean properties. 
 
@ControllerAdvice is used to handle the global exception and it is recommended.

@Service applied to service implementations
We don't use @Transactoional at DAO layer it will be handled at service layer
the DAO does not handle the transactional, instead, it's managed at the service layer.

This service layer will actually
sit between our employee controller and our employee DAO.
