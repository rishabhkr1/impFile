Enum
------
Enums represents a list of constant variable in java.
 Enums help make the code more readable and maintainable by giving meaningful names
 to otherwise arbitrary numeric or string values.

As example if we have restaurant
and methods like
order_placed,order_accepted,food_prepared,order_pickeup,order_delivered;

@Enumerated have 2 parameter
    .Ordinal(It store the order of enum) Not recommended
    .String (Store in a database as String)
